# How to update

Step 1 : go to the server folder, then in config.js, put the MongoDB URL. Next, write all your client code in the src/client/ folder (if you want) , then when you wanna `git push` or test the app, run `./start` in the console or do `node pack.js && node .` ! client/Remember.js should update with your modified code.

Remember, when you make a new JS file in src/client/, remember to put it in the JSON object found in `pack.js`. Add it in the order you want it to load.
And as always, before you `git push`, always test!
